# ðŸŒŒ SpectralCA: Spectral Cross-Attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification

This repository implements a hybrid model architecture for hyperspectral image classification, combining **3D convolutions** with a custom-designed **Spectral Cross-Attention (SpectralCA)** mechanism. The method fuses spatial and spectral representations symmetrically and efficiently, achieving a balance between accuracy and inference speed.

The model improves on the MDvT architecture by replacing MobileViTBlock with the custom SpectralCA block.

## ðŸ§  Research Summary

The SpectralCA block is designed for **hyperspectral image (HSI)** classification, with a special focus on:

- Preserving **geometric structure** of scenes
- Enhancing **feature fusion** via dual-directional **cross-attention**
- Reducing model **size and inference time**

This method was evaluated on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset and compared to MobileViTBlock within the MDvT architecture.

## ðŸ“ˆ SpectralCA Architecture

The architecture consists of two branches:

- A **2D convolutional stream** for spatial features
- A **3D convolutional stream** for spectral features
- Two **cross-attention heads**:
  - Spatial â†’ Spectral
  - Spectral â†’ Spatial

Final feature maps are concatenated and projected using 3D convolutions.

## ðŸ’¡ Semi-Supervised Learning

The model supports **SSL via proxy labeling** (self-training).  
The process:

1. Train on a small labeled subset
2. Predict pseudo-labels on unlabeled data
3. Retrain on confident predictions
4. Iterate until convergence

SSL enables effective training in scenarios with limited labeled data â€” highly relevant for agricultural and military HSI applications.
